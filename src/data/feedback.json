It\u2019s the first group in the city which doesn\u2019t shy away from sharing feedback to players in order to not compromise the quality of the games. To have the assurance that the game you have waited for the entire week is guaranteed to have players who have showed the potential to make any game an exciting one evokes a positive ray of hope.",
